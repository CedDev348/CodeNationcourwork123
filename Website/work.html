                        I began to look for different projects online and started to get more more involved. Those 3weeks might have been short, however I managed to gain a lot of insights, while searching for projects to work on in my own spare time.
                        I currently started to develop a Super Mario Games using JavaScript. Very challenging, and push me to learn even more about the different concepts and logics that need to be implemented.
