                Strategy would be one of them. Before starting a website, you need to you need to be clear on the basics: 
                What are you trying to achieve with your new website? What is your websiteâ€™s main purpose? 
                
                <h2>Game Designers</h2> 
                
                They need to have several soft skills and hard skills; a good Game Designer should be able 
                 communicate his/her ideas effectively (Technical Writing) and be able to influence and 
                 motivate a team (Storyboarding). Designers often draft early visualization of game features 
                 before Coders start the final creation process. A huge part of a designer is to align everyone 
                 on the vision for the product. On the technical side, being skilled in graphics programming such 
                 as Adobe (Photoshop, Adobe Xd...) help for a better visualization and presenting ideas. Scripting 
                 language like LUA is also important for things like designing levels and events. </p>
