                1.4 - A good example would be design thinking process. Design thinking has a massive influence on product design, however, isn’t a process that can be used immediately. Let’s say your start designing a character, now you ask yourself how does that translate into feature? How does that translate into what you are trying to project? That’s where the problem occurs; design thinking doesn’t translate practically to building a product. Projects tend to get stuck on it because the thinking is only thought as a mindset when it should as a system.  </p>
