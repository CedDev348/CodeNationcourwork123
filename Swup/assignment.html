            <p style="text-align: justify;">1.1 - Business process happen in the real world. Let’s say we have a hiring process, 
                the job is advertised, candidates are interviewed, decisions are made and just like 
                that a new person turns up at work. Or let’s say we have an accounts payable process, 
                we get an invoice from a vendor, we then make sure it’s valid, then someone approves it, 
                the cheque is collected and sent to the vendor.</br></br> Everyday in a typical business there are 
                thousands of transactions like these that follow some process or another. In fact, there are so 
                many that we can’t possibly keep track without help. IT is the use of systems for storing, 
                retrieving and sending information. In businesses use IT in order to analyse and visualise data 
                collected in order to better understand and gain valuable insight into how their business is 
                performing. This system helps business in making smarter decisions to their business grow and 
                evolve. </p>
