                Different disabilities sometimes require similar accommodations. 
                Visual conditions can range from mild to extreme, 
                but all can affect your web usage. It is common for some users to wear glasses when browsing the web, 
                as they might while reading a book, but this is also a sign of a mild visual disability. 
                Site difficulties include low vision, which is the struggle to see the content or text on a screen. 
                Struggling to decipher letters or words and being completely unable to see are issues faced by visually disabled web users. 
            </br>Web developers must be careful about how their codes are written to display content and text.
                While it might look excellent as it was intended on one screen, viewing it at a different 
                resolution or on a different, mobile device should not destroy the visuals. 
                Making sure that websites have a uniform appearance across browsers is one way to ensure 
                functionality for all users. Text should be displayed prominently or be able to have its size 
                adjusted and overlaid on a static, non-busy background so that it can be easily read. 
                Screen-readers and braille-keyboards are also great tools to help the visually impaired get the 
                most of their web usage.
