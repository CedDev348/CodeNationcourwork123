                Finding stock objects and existing implementations is often quicker, 
                cheaper and more practical than producing your own. Whether free or not, 
                these resources normally come with a license to ensure fair use.
                
                Licenses are granted by an authority to allow a usage; in my case, 
                the use and distribution of resources by the copyright owner (i.e. me). 
            </br></br>I may decide to offer my photograph for free or charge a price; either way, 
                I can include a license to limit usage, and I maintain the copyright. 
                Just because someone pays money doesn’t mean they have full control or rights to what 
                they’re buying. Creative artist's control of original work: the legal right of creative 
                artists or publishers to control the use and reproduction of their original works. 
                You have to have permission before using it.</p>
